            <span class="Normal">A planet can be owned by one of the 4 teams.  In rare cases, a failed attempt to capture a planet may result in that planet having 0 armies and being “independent”.  Independent planets appear gray.  A planet that has not been visited by your team since the start of the game, or since the last time it was captured, will also appear gray.</span>

            <span class="Normal">You can use the l (lowercase L) command to “lock on” to a planet and, when you get there, orbit it.  A planet with more than 4 armies will also show the army icon on its left side.  When you orbit a friendly or enemy planet, you can bomb it (b), beam up armies (z) or beam down armies (x).  Bombing is only effective when there are more than 4 enemy armies.  The last few enemy armies have to be destroyed by beaming down armies.  Bombing, followed by 5 armies, is generally sufficient to capture any enemy planet.</span>
