        <p class="Left Heading2">
            <span class="Heading2">Bronco</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Left Normal">
            <span class="Normal">Bronco Netrek servers are “standard” Netrek servers with 6 ship types and standard weapons and gameplay.  pickled.netrek.org and continuum.uc.netrek.org are Bronco servers.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Left Heading2">
            <span class="Heading2">Sturgeon</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Left Normal">
            <span class="Normal">Sturgeon servers add some special weapons (missiles for example) and ships (this client calls it the battlecruiser for legal reasons).  This client does not support all Sturgeon features but is playable on Sturgeon servers.  netrek.beesenterprises.com is a Sturgeon server.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Left Heading2">
            <span class="Heading2">Paradise</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Left Normal">
            <span class="Normal">Paradise was a Netrek variant including larger numbers of ships, large map, star clusters, and more strategic gameplay.  Paradise required a custom client.  This client does not support Paradise mode.  There are no known operational Paradise Netrek servers at this time.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Left Heading2">
            <span class="Heading2">Hockey</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Left Normal">
            <span class="Normal">Netrek Hockey was a silly but fun Netrek variant where you use improved tractor and pressor beams to move a “puck” into the “enemy goal” to score.  Standard Bronco clients should work with Netrek Hockey, but there are no known operational Netrek Hockey servers online at this time.</span>

            <span class="Heading2">Other variants</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Left Normal">
            <span class="Normal">There were other Netrek server types, including “Chaos”, “Base Practice”, “International Netrek League”.</span>
