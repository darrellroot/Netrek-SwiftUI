This information will show up on the tactical map for 2 seconds, plus in the message window in the bottom right (this is useful when getting information for a far away planet or player on the strategic map).</span>

            <span class="Normal">R will stop your ship, lower your shields, and start repairs.  This increases the normal repair rate.  Orbiting a friendly planet with a repair icon, or being docked with a friendly starbase, will also increase the repair rate.  Any movement or weapon command will cancel repairs.</span>

            <span class="Normal">A starbase can permit or deny permission for friendly ships to dock with it.  This is to prevent a starbase at the front lines from being crippled by friendly ships exploding on top of it.  Some netrek clients support a “transwarp to the starbase”, which this also denies.  This client does not currently support transwarping to the starbase.</span>
